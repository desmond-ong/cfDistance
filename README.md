==========

This repository contains materials for the following paper:

This repository is maintained by Desmond Ong. Questions, comments, requests for clarification or replication, etc, should be directed to desmond (dot) ong (at) stanford (dot) edu


#### Note:
The meta-analysis reported in the non-archival version of this CogSci paper was added into a revised version of Ong, Zaki, & Goodman, which is currently under review. This revision was made after the CogSci paper was accepted. The data and analysis code for that paper can be found at github.com/desmond-ong/affCog

### Data

The data for the first 2 experiments presented in the paper are in the /data folder.


### Analysis code

Analysis code is provided in nearMiss_analysis.Rmd (a R Markdown document). 

The file contains all the R code necessary to replicate the analyses reported in the paper (excluding the meta-analysis, which can be found at github.com/desmond-ong/affCog)


### Sample Experiments

A sample of our experiments is also included in the repository.

If you do finish an experiment, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had it been running live. The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:
