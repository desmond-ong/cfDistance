Notes:
Export from Quicktime with audio

audio tracks are separate, so have to combine them with Audacity (Tracks --> Mix and Render)

Then use iMovie to align the tracks (nasty trimming here...). Can try to fix crop but may introduce black bars

Finally use Miro to convert to .ogg and .websm as well
